## Research Focus

I develop predictive modeling frameworks that connect electronic structure calculations to catalytic performance under realistic operating conditions.

Electronic Structure → Surface Reactivity → Microkinetics → Data-Driven Acceleration

My work integrates periodic DFT, mechanistic modeling, and data-driven methods to understand and optimize heterogeneous catalytic systems.
